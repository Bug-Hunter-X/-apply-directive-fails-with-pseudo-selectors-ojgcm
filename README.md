This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS where the @apply directive does not correctly handle CSS pseudo-selectors such as :hover.  The bug.css file showcases the issue, and bugSolution.css provides a workaround.  The issue stems from the way @apply processes and merges CSS classes, specifically how it handles pseudo-selectors that are part of the class names.  The workaround involves applying the pseudo-selector directly without using @apply.
