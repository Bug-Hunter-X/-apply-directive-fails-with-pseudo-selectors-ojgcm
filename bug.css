This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't properly handle the pseudo-selector, resulting in the styles not being applied correctly or unexpectedly. For instance, trying to apply hover styles using `@apply hover:bg-blue-500` might not work as expected because `@apply` only applies the base styles and ignores the pseudo-selector.
